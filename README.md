## Technologies Used

- React
- Bootstrap CSS

## Features

- Fetches jokes from an API
- Displays jokes on the screen
- Allows the user to generate new jokes with a button click

## Installation

Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
Navigate to the project directory: `cd joke-generator`
Install the dependencies: `npm install`


## How It Works

The application fetches a joke from the Joke API, when it loads.
If the joke type is "single," the joke is displayed as it is.
If the joke type is "twopart," the setup and delivery are combined and displayed as one joke.
Clicking the "New Joke" button, triggers a new API call to fetch a new joke, which, is then displayed on the screen.


## Acknowledgements

This project was created as a learning exercise to practice React and API integration. It makes use of the Joke API for fetching jokes.
